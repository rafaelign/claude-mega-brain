Real agentic sessions (`claude -p`), Claude Sonnet 4.6.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add guhcostan/claude-mega-brain
/plugin install claude-mega-brain@guhcostan
```

Then create a knowledge base in any project:

```bash
mkdir okf/
cat > okf/tables/orders.md << 'EOF'
---
type: BigQuery Table
title: Orders
description: One row per completed customer order.
---
EOF
```

Start a new Claude Code session — the knowledge base is loaded automatically.

---

## The problem

Without claude-mega-brain, Claude answers project-specific questions from training data — and gets them wrong:

```
User: What column stores the order total, and what type is it?

Claude (no context): Common conventions are total_amount (DECIMAL) or amount (FLOAT)...
# Wrong. The project uses amount_cents (INT64).
```

With claude-mega-brain, the schema is injected at session start:

```
<mega-brain>
OKF: ./okf/ (4 concepts)
  tables/orders.md [BigQuery Table] — One row per completed order
  tables/customers.md [BigQuery Table] — Customer profiles
  metrics/wau.md [Metric] — Weekly active users
  metrics/net_revenue.md [Metric] — Net revenue after refunds
</mega-brain>

User: What column stores the order total, and what type is it?

Claude: Based on tables/orders.md — amount_cents (INT64).
# Correct, first turn, no tool calls needed.
```

## Benchmark Results

6 knowledge-retrieval questions, project-specific values unknowable from training data.
Real `claude -p` agentic sessions — not simulated.

| metric | no context | Obsidian+MCP | **claude-mega-brain** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| accuracy | 67% | 17% | **100%** |
| tool calls avg | 0.7 | 4.0 | **0** |
| tokens avg | 42,519 | 175,461 | **16,025** |
| latency avg ms | 9,508 | 17,298 | **3,543** |

Obsidian+MCP makes 4 tool calls per question exploring the vault and still gets the answer wrong — the notes lack exact schema values. claude-mega-brain injects the structured OKF index once at `SessionStart` and answers in a single turn.

## How it compares

| tool | format | auto-inject | schema enforcement | works with Claude Code |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **claude-mega-brain** | Markdown + YAML | SessionStart hook | required (`type:`) | ✓ native |
| Obsidian + MCP | Markdown | manual setup | none | requires MCP config |
| Notion | proprietary DB | manual | proprietary | no |
| Logseq | Markdown blocks | plugin-based | none | no |
| mem.ai | AI-organized | none | none | no |

Only claude-mega-brain injects automatically at session start with zero config.

---

## How It Works

At `SessionStart`, a hook scans your project for an OKF knowledge base and injects a compact index:

```
<mega-brain>
OKF: ./okf/ (8 concepts)
Read index.md first, then follow links.

Recent (log.md):
  2026-06-29 — added customers table

  index.md [Index] — Central reference for all sales data
  tables/orders.md [BigQuery Table] — One row per completed order
  tables/customers.md [BigQuery Table] — Customer profiles
  metrics/wau.md [Metric] — Weekly active users definition
  ...
</mega-brain>
```

Claude knows exactly what exists and where. No exploration needed.

When Claude reads an OKF file, linked concepts are automatically surfaced via a `PostToolUse` hook — navigating the knowledge graph without extra prompting.

---

## OKF Format

Each concept is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Only `type` is required:

```markdown
---
type: BigQuery Table
title: Orders
description: One row per completed customer order.
resource: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=acme&d=sales&t=orders
tags: [sales, revenue]
timestamp: 2026-06-29T00:00:00Z
---

# Schema
| Column       | Type   | Description               |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| order_id     | STRING | Globally unique order ID  |
| customer_id  | STRING | FK to [customers](../tables/customers.md) |

# Joins
Joined with [customers](../tables/customers.md) on `customer_id`.
```

### Reserved files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.md` | Full knowledge map — Claude reads this first |
| `log.md` | Append-only changelog — last 3 entries injected at session start |

### Common types

`BigQuery Table` · `BigQuery Dataset` · `Metric` · `API` · `Runbook` · `Concept` · `Service`

Types are freeform — add your own.

---

## Installation

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add guhcostan/claude-mega-brain
/plugin install claude-mega-brain@guhcostan
```

### Local (development)

```bash
claude plugin install /path/to/claude-mega-brain
```

---

## Usage

Create a knowledge base in your project:

```bash
mkdir okf/
```

Add concepts:

```markdown
# okf/tables/orders.md
---
type: BigQuery Table
title: Orders
description: One row per completed customer order.
---
```

Start a new Claude Code session — the knowledge base is loaded automatically.

### OKF directory names (first match wins)

| Name | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `okf/` | explicit, standard |
| `.okf/` | hidden, keeps root clean |
| `knowledge/` | generic |
| `brain/` | short |
| `.second-brain/` | thematic |

### Adding concepts with `/mega-brain-ingest`

```
/mega-brain-ingest
```

Invoke the ingest skill to create or update OKF files from existing documentation, schemas, or API specs.

---

## Config (`.mega-brain.json`)

Optional per-project overrides at the project root:

```json
{
  "dir": "knowledge",
  "maxConcepts": 100,
  "priorityTypes": ["Metric", "BigQuery Table"]
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `dir` | auto-detect | Custom OKF directory name |
| `maxConcepts` | `60` | Max concepts in injected index |
| `priorityTypes` | `[]` | Types to sort to the top of the index |

---

## FAQ

**Does it add overhead to every session?**
Only if an OKF directory exists in the project. No OKF dir → hook exits in <5ms, no context injected.

**Can I use it with an existing wiki or docs folder?**
Add YAML frontmatter with `type:` to any Markdown file and drop it in your OKF dir. That's the full migration.

**What if I have 500 concepts?**
Set `maxConcepts` in `.mega-brain.json`. The index stays compact; `index.md` holds the full map.

**Does it work without `index.md`?**
Yes. `index.md` is optional — Claude navigates via the injected list and concept links.
